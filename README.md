The *Constitution of the United States* came into force as the supreme law of the United States of America in 1789. The Constitution established, among other bodies, that part of the Congress known as the House of Representatives. Seats in the House are distributed to states in proportion to their population. To facilitate the accurate allotment of seats in the House, the Constitution also mandated that a census be conducted every ten years. 

The Constitution also established an "upper house" of the legislature, in contrast to the so called "lower house," that being the House of Representatives. This upper house is called the Senate, the name a reference to the ancient Roman Senate. While the House of Representatives allocates its seats based on population, the Senate doesn't take population into account; it simply grants two seats to each state.

Let us explore the consequences of this method of apportionment.
